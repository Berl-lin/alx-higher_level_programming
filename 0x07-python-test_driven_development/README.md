The project focuses on the writing of tests for programs. The aim is to encourage test driven coding and program development.

## 0x07-python-test_driven_development

### General Objectives

- Why Python programming is awesome
- What’s an interactive test
- Why tests are important
- How to write Docstrings to create tests
- How to write documentation for each module and function
- What are the basic option flags to create tests
- How to find edge cases

------------

## Resources

- [doctest — Test interactive Python examples (until “26.2.3.7. Warnings” included)](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/doctest.html)
- [doctest – Testing through documentation](https://pymotw.com/3/doctest/)
- [Unit Tests in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lfv5tUGsn8)


------------

## Procedure

- Write fail test
- Write program code
- Fail test the code
- Confirm code fails
- Write correct tests
- Correct test the code
- Confirm code works 
- Write more codes
- Write more fail and correct tests<br/>

TDD encourages coding with tests to improve the developer's confidence in their project/program and minimising errors, amongst other element of surprises that can pop-up. :wink:
